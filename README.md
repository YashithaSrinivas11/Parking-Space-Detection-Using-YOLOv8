**Project: Parking Space Detection Using YOLOv8 and Deep Learning**

1. **Goal**: To automatically detect available parking spaces in a parking lot using deep learning techniques.
2. **Tools**: 
   - **YOLOv8**: An advanced object detection algorithm to identify cars and empty spaces in images.
   - **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Used to process images and recognize patterns.
   - **Pickle File**: Stores the trained model so it can be easily loaded and used later for detection.

3. **Process**:
   - **Data Collection**: Capture images of the parking lot.
   - **Model Training**: Use YOLOv8 and CNNs to train the model on these images.
   - **Model Saving**: Save the trained model using a pickle file for future use.
   - **Detection**: Use the model to detect parking spaces in real-time.
